### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add progress feature

#### Implementation

The add progress feature adds a progress to an existing student's progress list in TutorAid. Each student can have up
to 10 progress entries. Adding a new entry to a student with 10 entries will result in the deletion of the oldest entry.

This feature implements the following operations:
* `AddProgressCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”Creates a Progress object and adds it to a ProgressList object of a Student object
in TutorAid.

It is also facilitated by the methods below:
* `TutorAidParser#parseCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks for the command word that is required for the addition of a progress.
* `AddCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks for the command flag that specifies the addition of a progress.
* `AddProgressCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the individual arguments to create a Progress object.

When a Student object is created, a ProgressList object is created for this Student object. This ProgressList object
stores an ArrayList of type Progress that keeps track of a maximum of 10 Progress objects. We implement `ProgressList`
as a field in `Student`.

![ProgressListClass](images/StudentWithProgressListClassDiagram.png)

Given below is an example of what happens when the user attempts to add a progress entry to a student in TutorAid
by entering a command:

`add -p 2 Did Homeworkâ€‹`

1. `LogicManager#execute()` is executed, where the above user input is passed into `TutorAidParser#parseCommand()`.

2. `TutorAidParser#parseCommand()` then extracts the first keyword of every command. Since the keyword `add` would be
   extracted, the remaining arguments of the command (`-p 2 Did Homeworkâ€‹`) are then passed into
   `AddCommandParser#parse()`.

3. `AddCommandParser#parse()` extracts the command flag `-p` at the start of its argument, which denotes the addition
   of a progress. Thus, the remaining (`2 Did Homeworkâ€‹`) is then passed into `AddProgressCommandParser#parse()`.

4. The remaining (`2 Did Homeworkâ€‹`) is then parsed into index `2` and progress description `Did Homework`, which
   are then used to construct an `AddProgressCommand` object. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
At this point, if `AddProgressCommandParser#parse()` detects that invalid input has been supplied, the command will fail 
its execution and `ParseException` will be thrown.</div>

Below is the sequence diagram that depicts the parsing of the `add -p` command:
![ParseAddProgress](images/ParseAddProgressSequenceDiagram.png)

5. `LogicManager#execute()` then calls upon `AddProgressCommand#execute()`. It communicates with the `Model` to get the
   index-specified `Student` instance.

Below is the sequence diagram that depicts how `AddProgressCommand` gets the student to edit:
![GetStudentToAddProgress](images/GetStudentToAddProgressSequenceDiagram.png)

6. `AddProgressCommand` calls the `Student#addProgress()` to add the new progress to the specified student.

7. `AddProgressCommand` then calls the `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()` to update the data in the system with
   regard to this change.

8. The result of the `AddProgressCommand` execution is then encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object, which is
   returned to `LogicManager`.

Below is the sequence diagram that depicts the process of the adding a progress to a student:
![AddProgressToStudent](images/AddProgressToStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to keep track of all the progress (maximum 10) of a student:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implements a ProgressList class.
    * Pros: Abstracts away the management of progress from the Student class.
    * Cons: Potentially more dependency.

* **Alternative 2:** Implements an ArrayList of type Progress in the Student class.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: Student class may have too many responsibilities.

### Add student feature

#### Implementation

The 'add student' feature adds a student contact to TutorAid. A student contact consists of the student's name, 
student's contact number, the parent's name and parent's contact number. 

The feature is mainly implemented by the following methods:
* `AddStudentCommand::execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds a `Student` object to TutorAid.
  
It is also additionally facilitated by the methods below:
* `TutorAidParser#parseCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks for the command word that is required for the addition of a student 
  contact.
* `AddCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks for the command flag that specifies the addition of a student contact.
* `AddStudentCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the individual arguments to create a `Student` object.
* `ModelManager#addStudent()`â€‰â€”â€‰Represents the in-memory model of TutorAid's student book data.
* `StudentBook#addStudent()`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds a student to TutorAid's student book.

Given below is an example of what happens when the user attempts to add a student contact to TutorAid by entering 
a command `add -s sn/John Doe â€¦â€‹`:

1. The command is first passed into `TutorAidParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the first keyword of every command. 
   Since the keyword `add` would be extracted, the remaining arguments of the command (`-s sn/John Doe â€¦â€‹`) are passed 
   then into `AddCommandParser#parse()`.

2. `AddCommandParser#parse()` extracts the command flag `-s` at the start of its argument, which denotes the addition 
   of a student contact. Thus, the remaining (`sn/John Doe â€¦â€‹`) is passed into `AddStudentCommandParser#parse`.

3. Each of the different arguments of student contact, such as the student name, student contact number, parent name 
   and parent number, is parsed by `AddStudentCommandParser#parse()` based on the given input. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
At this point, if `AddStudentCommandParser#parse()` detects that no student name has been supplied, the command will fail 
its execution and `ParseException` will be thrown.
</div>

4. For optional parameters, which are all parameters other the student's name, if the argument is not supplied by the
   user, a default argument (`""`) is instead supplied by the `AddStudentCommandParser#parse()`.

Below is the sequence diagram that depicts the parsing of the `add -s` command:
![ParseAddStudentCommand](images/ParseAddStudentCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

5. The individual arguments for the student contact are then passed into `Model#Student()` to create a `Student` object. 

6. The `AddStudentCommand#execute()` is then called upon to add the student into TutorAid. This in turn calls on 
   `ModelManager#addStudent()` and `StudentBook#addStudent()` to store the details of the new student contact in memory. 
   
7. Lastly, a `CommandResult` object is returned to notify the user that the student has been successfully added.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
If the student object created appears to be a duplicate of an existing contact (a contact is said to be a duplicate if 
all of its fields are the same as that of an existing contact), the new student object will not be stored in 
TutorAid and user will be alerted of the duplicate instead. 
</div>

Below is the sequence diagram that depicts an overview of a student contact being successfully added to TutorAid:
![AddStudent](images/AddStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to differentiate the `add -s` command from other `add` commands:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `add` command word and `-s` command flag 
  are parsed one after another, in two different classes. 
    * Pros: Better use of abstraction and increases cohesion, where one class only extracts the command word and 
      another class extracts the command flag.
    * Cons: Time taken to execute the command may increase as more classes and methods are required to execute it.

* **Alternative 2:** The `add` command word and `-s` command flag are parsed in the same class, by the same method. 
    * Pros: Command can be executed quickly as only one method is required to parse the command.
    * Cons: Having a single parse method may result in the method having multiple responsibilities to parse various 
      parts of a command, such as the command word, command flag and arguments.
    

### Delete student feature

#### Implementation

The delete feature deletes a student contact from TutorAid. 

The feature is mainly implemented by the following methods:
* `DeleteStudentCommand#execute()` in `DeleteStudentCommand` class: Deletes a student from TutorAid

It is also additionally facilitated by these methods:
* `TutorAidParser#parseCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks for the command word that is required for the deletion of a student.
* `DeleteCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks for the command flag that specifies the deletion of a student.
* `DeleteStudentCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the student index specified.

### View student/lesson feature

#### Implementation

The proposed view student/lesson mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It implements `Model`, stored internally as a `modelManagerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `ModelManager#viewStudent()`â€‰â€”â€‰Updates student panel with the student of interest and lesson panel with the lessons the student of interest is in.
* `ModelManager#viewLesson()`â€‰â€”â€‰Updates lesson panel with the lesson of interest and student panel with the students that are in this lesson of interest.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#viewStudent()` and `Model#viewLesson()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view student mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `ModelManager` will be initialized with the initial model manager state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single model manager state.

![ViewStudentState0](images/ViewStudentState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `view -s 1` command to view the 1st student in TutorAid. The `view -s` command calls `Model#viewStudent()`, causing the modified state of model manager after the `view -s 1` command executes to be saved in the `modelManagerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that model manager state.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view student operation works:

![ViewStudentSequenceDiagram](images/ViewStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

A similar execution scenario can be expected for view lesson mechanism.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How view student/lesson executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Filters and updates view panel on command.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Filter list beforehand and update view panel on command.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `view -s`, just load the pre-generated student panel).
    * Cons: We must ensure that all possible view panels combinations are covered and this might cause slower application initialization.
    
### Card-like UI Elements

Card-like UI elements are objects that are shown to the user in their respective list panels, such as `StudentCard` which is displayed in the `StudentListPanel`. These cards come in two flavours: a fully-detailed variant and a minimally-detailed variant. The fully-detailed variant shows all properties while the minimally-detailed variant keeps the list compact and allows the user to view more entries. 

These UI elements inherit the `Card` class, which in turn inherits `UiPart<Region>`. 

![CardClassDiagram](images/CardClassDiagram.png)

At all times, the `LessonListPanel` and `StudentListPanel` in the `MainWindow` will display Lessons and Students from the model using either the fully-detailed or minimal `Card` objects. The variant being displayed depends on the user command: `list -a` will cause both panels to display all details while `list` will cause both panels to display only minimal details. Most other commands that affect the `Model` will cause all information to be displayed.

There are thus two static instances of `StudentListPanel` and `LessonListPanel` each - one for each variant. Every time the `Model` is updated, `MainWindow#fillStudentCard` and `MainWindow#fillLessonCard` will be called to ensure that the correct variant is displayed in the `MainWindow`. The sequence diagram below shows how this works:

![CardUiSequence](images/CardUiSequence.png)

When `fillStudentCard(true)` or `fillLessonCard(true)` are called, the `studentListPanelPlaceholder` and `lessonListPanelPlaceholder` in `MainWindow` are cleared of its nodes to prepare them to accept new nodes (panels). Then, the correct `studentListPanel` and `lessonListPanel` with all details are inserted, thus displaying the fully-detailed panels to the user.

Conversely, if a user chooses to hide the details, `UiManager#hideViewWindow()` will be called instead, which will call `fillStudentCard(false)` and `fillLessonCard(false)` and hide the details.

The above applies to the scenario when the user inputs a command which calls a method that changes the detail visibility of the cards. In contrast, during the application launch, `MainApp` calls the `start` method of `UiManager` which calls `MainWindow#fillInnerParts`. The details are shown below:

![CardUiSequenceLaunch](images/CardUiSequenceLaunch.png)

The panels default to the minimal panels for the application launch.


### Set/Unset payment made feature

#### Implementation

The purpose of the set/unset payment made feature is for tutors to modify a student's payment status.

This feature implements the following operations:

* `PaidCommand#execute()` - Updates the payment status of the student to `paid`.
* `UnpaidCommand#execute()` - Updates the payment status of the student to `unpaid`.

This feature is facilitated by the following operations:

* `TutorAidParser#parseCommand()` - Calls `PaidCommandParser#parse()` or `UnpaidCommandParser#parse()` with the specified student index, depending on the command word in the user input.
* `PaidCommandParser#parse()` - Returns an instance of `PaidCommand`.
* `UnpaidCommandParser#parse()` - Returns an instance of `UnpaidCommand`.

To represent a student's payment status, a `PaymentStatus` class is introduced. It stores an immutable instance variable `hasPaid`, of boolean type. We then work with the `Student` model, and implement `PaymentStatus` as a field in `Student`.

<img src="images/StudentWithPaymentStatusClassDiagram.png" width="150" />

Given below is an example usage scenario for setting a student's payment status as `paid`, and how the command is executed.

1. The user executes `paid 2` command to set the payment status of the 2nd student in the address book. `LogicManager#execute()` is executed, where the user input is passed into `TutorAidParser#parseCommand()`. This in turn calls `PaidCommandParser#parse()`, which returns a `PaidCommand` instance if the index is valid.

<img src="images/ParsePaidCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="650" />

2. `LogicManager#execute()` then calls upon `PaidCommand#execute()`. It communicates with the `Model` to get the index-specified `Student` instance.

3. A `PaymentStatus` instance with the `hasPaid` variable set to `true` is created. This is then passed into the constructor of `Student`, along with the values of the other existing fields of the index-specified student, to create a new `Student` instance.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions happening within the `Logic` and `Model` components in Steps 2 and 3.

<img src="images/ConstructEditedStudentSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" height="275" />

4. `Model#setStudent()` is then called upon to replace the existing `Student` instance in the `StudentBook` with the newly created instance. 

5. The result of the `PaidCommand` execution is then encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object, which is returned to `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions happening within the `Logic` and `Model` components in Steps 4 and 5.

<img src="images/SetEditedStudentSequenceDiagram.png" width="500" />

A similar execution scenario can be expected for setting a student's payment status as `unpaid`.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope
**Target user profile**:

A private tutor that:
* has a need to manage a significant number of students' details
* prefers desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: manage students' details faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app
